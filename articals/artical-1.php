                        <p>This is a familiar question and asked first in every interview. The answer should be tiny and
                            correct, which will make a good impression. Start by telling about your qualification then
                            mention where you live and now because you are a fresher, tell them so far you do not have
                            any experience.  </p>

                        <h5 class="tips">Tip No#1</h5>
                        <p>Several movies were released in 2019. Some of them were very good for me, such as Captain
                            Marvel. In the Captain Marvel movie, I got some life lessons which were like a motivation
                            for me, Captain Marvel's character Brie Larson has done in this movie. Captain Marvel is an
                            action movie that has a lot of entertainment and you will not be bored. Captain Marvel is a
                            supernatural warrior in this movie which is caught in the fight with the Skrulls. Living on
                            Earth in 1995, she keeps having recurring memories of another life as U.S. Air Force pilot
                            Carol Danvers, with the help of Nick Fury; He detects all the secrets of his past and ends
                            the war with the Skrulls. Captain Marvel got to teach me, emotions are not weakness, and
                            they can be your greatest strength, we should never go with the bad memories of our past
                            because with that we make happy moments too bad, the most important thing that I felt was
                            that we should never give up.</p>
                        <h5 class="tips">Tip No#2</h5>
                        <p>The last movie I saw was Aladdin, Aladdin is a movie full of love and entertainment. The
                            story of Aladdin movie might be known to everyone, which is a very funny movie in this movie
                            street rat Aladdin frees a genie from a lamp, he finds his wishes granted. However, he soon
                            finds that the evil has other plans for the lamp — and for Princess Jasmine. But Aladdin
                            save Princess Jasmine and his love for her. There are a lot of things to learn that from
                            this movie to all of us like Be as you are, do not try to be like others, Believe in
                            yourself, no matter what other people think of you, how much they humiliate you. Always
                            Appreciate True Friendships.</p>
